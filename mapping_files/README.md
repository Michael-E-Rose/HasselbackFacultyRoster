Files used for aggregation of faculty members and institutions.

Institutions are mapped to the offical name (reference: en.wikipedia.org).
Faculty members are mapped to the ID of their Scopus Author profile.  In absence of a profile ID, authors are listed in `unmapped.csv`.
If you know of correct mappings in either case, please add them to the mapping files and create a pull request!
